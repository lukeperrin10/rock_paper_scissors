# Takeaways 

I think what I will take away from this is that planning is super important. 
I have a working game, however I am not happy with my performance. 
I should have put more time to doing more with this and developing the app more. 
I have learnt probably more about what I need to correct in my ways of working, 
I got too stuck on the visual aspect of working on the client side, trying to get things
to see just right, when I should have concentrated on the logic more.  Moving forward I think 
I will try this excercise again and concentrate on the logic, work on refactoring, try some more 
advanced techniques.
